The feature I added is the ability to use the Yo app to send invitations to events. This feature sends a simple message and a location. which are both features already included within the app, but adds the ability for the user to reply yes or no. While designing the feature a realized that by removing the location aspect the feature could be used to send simple yes or no questions, so I created an example of that as well.

#### Ethical Issues
##### The Yo app does not make any disclosure as to whether it collects personal and uses user data.
##### The Yo app is very simple and requires minimal user data decreasing opportunity for the invasion of user privacy.
##### The simplicity of the Yo app also makes it unlikely that it could cause harm to users.

#### Legal Issues
##### The invite feature I added and the standard Yo app allow users to send their location. Most countries have laws governing the distribution of location data.
##### The Yo app has no age requirements meaning all aspects of the app have to meet legal standards for minors. This would be espessially important to a feature that allows users to send invotations to events in the real world.
##### The Yo app includes a store. From browsing the store it was unclear whether anything can actually be purchased within the app, but if there are any purchases they will have to follow any relavant laws mediating financial transactions.

#### Professional Issues
##### The Yo app has an api that allows yos to be sent to groups. Companies that utilize the api may not uphold professional standards
##### The Yo app could be considered a system that becomes integrated into the infrastructure of society. As a result it will be held to higher standards due to its potential to impact society.
##### The AMC requires members to "Design and implement systems that are robustly and usably secure." The Yo app was hacked at one point allowing the hacker acces to any users phone number.

#### Spain privacy laws
##### Laws in Spain diffrentiate between "online" and "offline" apps. Social networking apps fall under the online category which is the more stringent of the two and requires adherance to LOPD regulations which cover the collection of information.
##### There is also a distinction between "invasive" and "noninvasive" apps. Once again the Yo app is in the more stringent category, in this case qualifying as invasive. This means the app must adhere to LSSI regulations which cover location  data and advertisements.
##### Laws reguarding mobile apps in Spain have a particular focus on minors. If an app collects information a users must give informed consent before installation. Minors can not give consent and a parent/guardian must consent for them. The Yo app does not violate any of Spains legal requirements as far as I'm aware.
